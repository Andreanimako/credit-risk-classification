# Credit Risk Analysis Report 
Module 20 challenge

## Overview

The goal of this analysis was to use machine learning to make predictions about whether a loan is likely to be "healthy" ie not defaulted, or is likely to be a high risk loan, given certain information about the loan characteristics, such as loan size and interest rate, and information about the beneficiary, such as borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts, total debt and derogatory remarks. the loan status was marked as being healthy or high risk based on these features.
A preview of the dataset used is shown below.
A logitstic regression model was used to train and test the machine and the accuracy of its prediction determined by generating a confusion matrix and classification report.
